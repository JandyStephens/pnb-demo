                                                They're Pinky and The Brain
                                                Yes Pinky and The Brain
                                                One is a genius
                                                The other's insane
                    
                                                They're laboratory mice
                                                Their genes have been spliced
                                                They're dinky
                                                They're Pinky and The Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain
                                                Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain
                                                Brain
        
                                                Spoken interlude
                                                BRAIN - Pinky, what are you doing?
                                                PINKY - Oh hello Brain. I can hear the ocean. Hahaha!
                                                BRAIN - Yes, and I'm sure the ocean can hear you as well
                                                PINKY - Oh, I hope so. Oh Brain,
                                                 don't feel all that comfortable in
                                                This human outfit. This is awful. Yuck!
                                                BRAIN - Pinky, we only need to do this for 17 years or
                                                So before we make enough tips to enforce our latest plan!
                                                PINKY - Oh, I hope so, Brain. How much do we need?
                                                BRAIN - About $182 million
                                                PINKY - Oh dear. We're gonna try...
                                                BRAIN - Yes. Pinky, are you pondering what I'm pondering?
                                                PINKY - I think so, Brain.
                                                But me and Pippi Longstockings, what would our children look like?
                                                BRAIN - No, Pinky.
                                                We need to go back to the lab to plan for tomorrow night!
                                                PINKY - Why, Brain, what are we gonna do tomorrow night?
                                                BRAIN - Steinberg Bar Mitzvah! And then,
                                                The same thing we do every night. Try to take over the world!
                                                PINKY - NARF!
                                                BRAIN - Yeah!
        
                                                Before each night is done
                                                Their plan will be unfurled
                                                By the dawning of the sun
                                                They'll take over the world

                                                Yes Pinky and The Brain
                                                Their twilight campaign
                                                Is easy to explain
        
                                                To prove their mousey worth
                                                They'll overthrow the Earth
                                                They're dinky
